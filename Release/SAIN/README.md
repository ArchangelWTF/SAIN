SAIN Grenades - Version 1.0
Bots will only react to grenades they can actually see!
Built in reaction time system as well that is based on their bot type and difficulty setting.

Planned Features:
Add ability for bots to hear grenade bounces and react based on that information as well.
Add ability for bots to hear grenade pins being pulled.

SAIN Flashlights Version 2.0
Added new Flashlight Detection System for AI. Shining a flashlight will alert bots your general position and they might investigate depending on the situation. This can be turned off in the f12 menu.
Added new modifier for detection speed if you are shining a light or laser at a bot. They will see you faster if you do so. This can be turned off in the f12 menu.
Fixed IR Lights and Lasers acting the same as visible flashlights for dazzle.
Visible Lasers will dazzle bots if aimed directly around their eyes.
Fixed Dazzle aim reduction and scatter stacking ontop of each other.
Patched existing AI behavior so bots without NVGs will no longer see IR Lights and IR Lasers as normal lights at night-time. (What the fuck BSG)

Huge thanks to DrakiaXYZ once again for helping me figure out how to detect what flashlight mode is currently enabled, and what that mode actually does. It was an absolute nightmare.
